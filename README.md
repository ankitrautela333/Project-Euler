# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require mathematical insights to solve efficiently.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The problems range from simple mathematical calculations to complex algorithmic challenges that test both mathematical knowledge and programming skills.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is solved in a separate file, typically as a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) for better documentation and visualization of the solution process.

```
